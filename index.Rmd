**Hello, World!**  
Welcome to my website. Here you can know everything about me, past, now and future.  
For now, I just start my new life in New York as a first-year graduate student in Columbia University. To be honest, I never expected that I would come to New York but just as the saying goes, life is a box of chocolate and you never know what you're going to get. Everything here is new and fascinating but living abroad on my own is really not easy. Yet, generally, I love studying and living here. ↖(^ω ^)↗

Winter is coming and let's sway in the wind.
